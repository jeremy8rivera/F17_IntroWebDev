For week 3, we needed to react to the [following article](http://mediatemple.net/blog/tips/five-important-considerations-for-wireframing/?utm_source=weekly_newsletter&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=aug17newsletter). This article pointed out that in order for a good website, there needed to be a sketch of the outline of the site, a good understanding of the audience the site is targeted toward, and having feedback early on. The importance of having feedback early is so there are no major mistakes during the base of the website that won’t be a hassle to fix later on. I think one of the major things the blog post misses is how to tackle the site. A good way to tackle the site is by working on the big picture then working ones way down to the minor details to ensure a proper layout and workflow.
