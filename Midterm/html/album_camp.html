				[Verse 1]<br/>
				I used to dream every night, now I never dream at all <br/>
				I'm hopin' that it's cause I'm livin' everything I want <br/>
				I used to wake up in a bed between my mom and aunt <br/>
				Playing with this Land Before Time toy from Pizza Hut <br/>
				My dad works nights, putting on a stone face <br/>
				He's saving up so we can get our own place <br/>
				In the projects, man that sounds fancy to me <br/>
				They called me fat nose, my mom say you handsome to me <br/>
				Mrs. Glover ma'am, your son is so advanced <br/>
				But he's acting up in class and keeps peeing in his pants <br/>
				And I just wanna fit in, but nobody was helping me out <br/>
				They talking hood shit and I ain't know what that was about <br/>
				Cause hood shit and black shit is super different <br/>
				So I'm talking hood shit and cool it now like New Edition <br/>
				Mom and dad wouldn't listen <br/>
				They left the Bronx so I wouldn't be that <br/>
				All their friends in NY deal crack <br/>
				It's weird, you think that they'd be proud of 'em <br/>
				But when you leave the hood <br/>
				They think that you look down on 'em <br/>
				The truth is we still struggle on a different plane <br/>
				7 dollars an hour, WIC vouchers, it's all the same <br/>
				Facebook messaging hopin' that could patch up shit <br/>
				But all they get now is, "Can your son read this script?" <br/>
				<br/>[Hook]<br/>
				There's a world we can visit if we go outside<br/>
				Outside, outside—we can follow the road<br/>
				There's a world we can visit if we go outside<br/>
				Outside, outside—no one knows<br/>
				There's a world we can visit if we go outside<br/>
				Outside, outside—we can follow the road<br/>
				There's a world we can visit if we go outside<br/>
				Outside, outside—no one knows<br/>
				<br/>
				[Verse 2]<br/>
				Yeah, Dad lost his job, mama worked at Mrs. Winner's<br/>
				Gun pulled in her face, she still made dinner<br/>
				“Donald watch the meter so they don’t turn the lights off"<br/>
				Workin' two jobs so I can get into that white school<br/>
				And I hate it there<br/>
				They all make fun of my clothes and wanna touch my hair<br/>
				And my uncle on that stuff that got my grandma shook<br/>
				Drug dealers roughed him up and stole his address book<br/>
				He’s supposed to pay ‘em back<br/>
				He owe 'em money but his bank account is zero<br/>
				So my momma made us sleep with Phillips heads<br/>
				Under the pillow, like that would do somethin'<br/>
				But she’s got six kids, she’s gotta do somethin'<br/>
				She don’t want me in a lifestyle like my cousin<br/>
				And he mad cause his father ain’t around<br/>
				He lookin’ at me now, like<br/>
				"Why you so fuckin lucky? I had a father too<br/>
				But he ain’t around so I'mma take it out on you"<br/>
				We used to say "I love you," now we only think that shit<br/>
				It feels weird that you’re the person I took sink baths with<br/>
				Street took you over, I want my cousin back<br/>
				The world sayin' what you are<br/>
				Because you’re young and black, don’t believe ‘em<br/>
				You’re still that kid who kept the older boys<br/>
				From teasin', for some reason<br/>
				<br/>[Hook]<br/>
				There's a world we can visit if we go outside<br/>
				Outside, outside—we can follow the road<br/>
				There's a world we can visit if we go outside<br/>
				Outside, outside—no one knows<br/>
				There's a world we can visit if we go outside<br/>
				Outside, outside—we can follow the road<br/>
				There's a world we can visit if we go outside<br/>
				Outside, outside—no one knows<br/>
				<br/>[Outro]<br/>
				Can you hear me now?<br/>
				Can you hear me now?<br/>
				Oh, help us Lord<br/>
				Oh, baby baby baby<br/>
